# Network Congestion Prediction

## Overview
This project predicts network congestion using ns-3 simulations and machine learning.

## Components
1. **ns-3 Simulation**: Simulates network traffic with clients, servers, and a hub.
2. **Synthetic Data**: Generates labeled time-series metrics for ML training.
3. **Machine Learning**: Trains an LSTM model to predict congestion.

## Requirements
- ns-3 (for simulation)
- Python 3.8+ (for ML)
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, tensorflow, matplotlib, seaborn

## Setup
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
